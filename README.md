# bikesharing

Overview

A team has asked for assistance in determining if a new idea is a good investment. The idea is to create a bike sharing business in Des Moines. The idea was based on the current bike sharing business in New York City. To determine if this is a good fit for the city of Des Moines, this analyst was asked to review information taken from Citibike data in 2019. The data was analyzed and broken down into types of users, the peak times bikes were rented and the number of users of the service. Jupyter Notebook and tableau were used for this project.

A story on Tableau was created with visualizations.

2.	Checkout Times by Gender
    This graph shows how long bikes were checked out per gender. This shows that males check out         bikes and usually check them out longer than females do.

3.	Trips by Weekday
    This graph shows that bikes are used most from 6 am - 10 am and from 4 pm - 9 pm Monday through       Friday. Bikes are used throughout the day on Saturday and Sunday.

6.	Top Starting Locations
    This map shows where the top starting locations are. This map when compared with the top ending       location map gives a good idea of how long a bike is rented and how far the rider is likely to        go.

Summary:

This analysis shows that more males are likely to subscribe to the bike sharing service than females. It also suggests that bikes are more likely to be used from 6 am to 10 am and from 4 pm to 10 pm. The peak hours analysis is important. It tells us that more bikes are needed at those times. It also suggests the best time for bike repairs. Based on the available data, bike repairs would be best completed after midnight for less disruption to the business. The starting and ending locations suggest the best areas to make bikes available for more effective use. 

Future Analysis:

While the top starting and ending locations were reviewed, it would be a good idea to review more areas where bikes are used. This could help determine where more bikes could be placed to help expand the business. This analyst suggests using more maps to see where other riders are venturing. 
Another analysis that could be useful would be to determine if a greater number of bikes are used during holidays. It would be interesting to see if families enjoy bike riding together during holidays. This could give some insight if more or less bikes are needed during those days.
